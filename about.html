			<p>I have bachelor’s degree in Psychology and an MBA in Business from <a href="uccs.edu" class="smalllink">UCCS</a> (University of Colorado, Colroado Springs). I am currently a medical staffing coordinator for UCHealth. 
			Basically, a very focused and specialized version of human resources specifically for doctors at Memorial Hospital. 
			I make sure that all of their certificates and credentials are up to date and clear for work so that they don’t potentially harm any patients.</p></article>

		<h2 class="aboutsub" >Cutural</h2>
		<p>I am a Korean American who has a lot of interest in both of my cultures. I like both Korean and American food and both kpop and rock. This can be any form of rock including but not limited to:

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hard rock</li>
			<li>punk rock</li>
			<li>all kinds of metal</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="aboutsub" >If you had a choice on where to live, where would you pick?</h2>
		<p>I do have to say the one place that I would love to live and visit is Japan. 
			Though I am Korean, I feel like I do not fit in in South Korea. There is a lot of safety and comfort in Japan when you slow down and enjoy the moment. 
			It is an amazing place to visit more than once in my opinion. I am not picky on where I would like to go but I do like Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo the best.</p>

			<h2 class="aboutsub" >Who inspires you the most?</h2>
			<p>Two people I look up to are <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/" class="smalllink">Keanu Reeve</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351/" class="smalllink">Ryan Renolds</a>. Ryan Renolds finds the humor in everything and seems to not let anything bring him down.
			Where as Keanu Reeves has been through hell and back. Through that he has learned to be okay, to be comfortable in his own skin, accept all life has to offer and remain humble through it all.</p> </article>
